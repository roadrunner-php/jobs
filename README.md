This repository contains the codebase PHP bridge using RoadRunner Jobs plugin.

## Installation

To install application server and Jobs codebase

```bash
$ composer require spiral/roadrunner-jobs
```

You can use the convenient installer to download the latest available compatible
version of RoadRunner assembly:

```bash
$ composer require spiral/roadrunner-cli --dev
$ vendor/bin/rr get
```

## Usage

First you need to add at least one jobs adapter to your RoadRunner configuration.
For example, such a configuration would be quite feasible to run:

```yaml
#
# RPC is required for tasks dispatching (client)
#
rpc:
    listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:6001

#
# This section configures the task consumer (server)
#
server:
    command: php consumer.php
    relay: pipes

#
# In this section, the jobs themselves are configured
#
jobs:
    consume: [ "local" ]        # List of RoadRunner queues that can be processed by 
                                # the consumer specified in the "server" section.
    pipelines:
        local:                  # RoadRunner queue identifier
            driver: memory      # - Queue driver name
            config:
                priority: 10    # - Pipeline priority
                prefetch: 10000 # - Number of job to prefetch from the driver until ACK/NACK.
```

> Read more about all available drivers on the
> [documentation](https://roadrunner.dev/docs/plugins-jobs/2.x/en) page.

After starting the server with this configuration, one driver named `local`
will be available to you.

The following code will allow writing and reading an arbitrary value from the
RoadRunner server.

```php
<?php

use Spiral\RoadRunner\Jobs\Jobs;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

// Jobs service
$jobs = new Jobs(RPC::create('tcp://127.0.0.1:6001'));

// Select "local" queue from jobs
$queue = $jobs->connect('local');

// Create task prototype with default headers
$prototype = $queue->create('echo')
    ->withHeader('attempts', 4)
    ->withHeader('retry-delay', 10)
;

// Execute "echo" task with Closure as payload
$task = $queue->dispatch(
    $prototype->withValue(static fn($arg) => print $arg)
);

var_dump($task->getId() . ' has been queued');
```
