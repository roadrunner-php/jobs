     * @param non-empty-string[] $topics adds topics to use for consuming.
     * Default: empty (will produce an error), possible to use regexp if consume_regexp is set to true.
     *
     * @param bool $consumeRegexp sets the client to parse all topics passed to topics as regular expressions.
     * When consuming via regex, every metadata request loads all topics, so that all topics can be passed to
     * any regular expressions. Every topic is evaluated only once ever across all regular expressions; either it
     * permanently is known to match, or is permanently known to not match.
     *
     * @param positive-int $maxFetchMessageSize Sets the maximum amount of bytes a broker will try to send during a
     * fetch, overriding the default 50MiB.
     *
     * @param positive-int $minFetchMessageSize Sets the minimum amount of bytes a broker will try to send during a
     * fetch, overriding the default 1 byte. With the default of 1, data is sent as soon as it is available.
     *
     * @param ConsumePartition[] $consumePartitions sets partitions to consume from directly and the
     * offsets  to start consuming those partitions from. This option is basically a way to explicitly consume from
     * subsets of partitions in topics, or to consume at exact offsets.
     *
     * @param ConsumerOffset $consumerOffset Sets the offset to start consuming from, or if OffsetOutOfRange is seen
     * while fetching, to restart consuming from.
